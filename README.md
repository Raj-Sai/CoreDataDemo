  Native framework provided by apple.
  Very fast processing to fetch data.
  You can manage large amount of database.
  Migration process is also simple.
  Very easy to add in your current source code.
  Apple provides good feature to handle relationship between two tables. Even SQLite is not have this type of feature.

  Day by day, apple improving this to make it better. So for long time purpose this is the best option for your application.
  Multithread is possible but by using different ’NSManagedObjectContext’

  Consuming more space as compared to SQLite
